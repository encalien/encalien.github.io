            <h3>Learning Resources</h3>
            <p>Since deciding on changing careers back in late 2018 I used a lot of different learning resources. From watching YouTube tutorials, to browsing documentation and renting library books to enrolling in some structured courses and practicing on exercises based websites.</p>
            <p>Here's a list of all the structured courses I took including certificates for the ones I completed 100%.</p>
            <p>Udemy learning platform:</p>
            <div class="course-intro">
                <div>
                    <h4><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/learn/" target="_blank">The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>This is the first course I started when I decided to fully commit to the idea of career change. I got to about 2/3, and then realised it's gotten too complex and I couldn't follow it very well anymore, so I put it on hold until I got some more basic knowledge.</p>
                        <p>I put all of my projects done through this course on GitHub:</p>
                        <ol>

                    <p>After realising I need a more well rounded course that will take me through the basics, I chose this one. It's probably still the best one I have done so far, I love the beginner friendly way Angela explains important concepts. It's still a beginner course though, so that was definitely not enough.</p>
                    <p>We did several small projects during this course, including browser based Simon Says game and a To Do List app, which I additionally worked on after the course, to add some more functionality.</p>

                    <p>To better understand different types of database structures and specifically use SQL I enrolled in this course.</p>
                    <p>It was short, but it gave me a bit more overview on how relational databases operate.</p>

                    <p>By this point I had a better understanding of core concepts of web development, but I felt I'm missing a lot of fundamentals I would otherwise get at university. I could only replicate what I saw in tutorials, but I wouldn't be able to solve basic algorithmic problems or even understand fundamentals of computer science.</p>
                    <p>I asked around and this course was top recommendation to get some insight into what I'm missing. I really enjoyed it, it was a bit short though, so there's still a lot of gaps.</p>

                    <p>To be fair, this one should have been on top of the list, as I bought it ages ago, when I first dipped my toes into any kind of programming. I was still studying to be a vet at that time and had no previous computer knowledge. I still bought it on discount, just to give me something to do, when I didn't have to study. I completed first two projects, but then it became way too complicated, and I couldn't fully commit during my studies.</p>
                    <p>5 years later, after completing the Computer Science course, I picked it up again. I started again from beginning and finished all but the last project. This one is still in progress, as I would like to create most of the assets myself, which will take some more time of learning to use Blender.</p>
                    <p>I only uploaded one (mainly because I'm mostly using assets given in the course) - it's one of the earlier projects in course, but I later upgraded it with power-ups, lives and random level generation.</p>

                    <p>By now I have done several courses, and attended Smart Ninja course too. It was time to try to start to create something on my own from scratch. However, I soon realised, my css understanding is not on high enough level. I had used mostly bootstrap before, and I wouldn't for the life of me be able to style a page by myself.</p>
                    <p>I chose this course mainly for the intermediate-advanced concepts, and I loved more ideas for the projects. I used the course as reference point where I could follow along where I needed to, but also just use it as inspiration for my own projects.</p>

                    <p>This is the latest course I did. Since I started working at Digital School I just couldn't find more than a couple hours per week to continue my learning. My work required me to invest a lot of time to learn to use different platforms such as Scratch or MIT App Inventor. And I created more and more there - simply because it's fun :D</p>
                    <p>I decided to use the free time I had to jump into learning Python, and this course was long on my wish list. I completed it recently, and all along used <a href="">this website <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> as practice guide.</p>
